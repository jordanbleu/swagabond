Swagabond is a catch-all solution for generating code or text output from an [OpenAPI spec](https://swagger.io/specification/).  It's similar to tools like Kiota, NSwag, etc but it is completely language agnostic and tempate driven.

## The Basics

* Write a template for an http client, documentation, or just about anything (this repo contains a few samples ðŸ™‚)
* Configure Swagabond into your build pipeline, via MSBuild (for dotnet projects), Github actions, gradle, or whatever
* Enjoy automatically generated output as your REST API grows and changes 

## Swagabond vs OpenAPI Generator

Swagabond is like a glass of plain Jack Daniels, OpenAPI Generator is like a whiskey old fashioned. Sometimes you just 
don't have time to muddle the cherries, and just wanna get drunk.

|          | Swagabond | OpenAPI Generator |
| -------- | -------   | ------- |
| Overall Vibe | Dumb, simple, easy to work with | Smart, powerful, higher learning curve |
| Best for | Prototyping, Simple APIs, Microservices, Internal tools, people with ADHD | Enterprise-scale applications, More nuanced OpenAPI Specs, People with lots of time |
| Learning Curve | Tiny, Can start writing a template instantly | Complicated, lots to learn |
| Template writing | Fewer options and features | Complex, more fully featured |
| Template syntax | Scriban, with more planned later | Mustache by default, but can write custom template engines |
| Object model | Every template gets the same exact object model | Varies based on each generator |
| Code-Gen Logic | Template driven | Varies, but each code generator exposes more code-specific nuances specific to the programming language |
